        <h1>Christmas Island</h1>
        <p>We invite you to uncover the remarkable surprises of this island full of natural wonders: from the unique annual red crab migration to rare and unusual birds and glorious deserted beaches, yet it also displays a curious amalgam of
          cultures,
          history and industry, emerging as a place where all these elements create a truly unusual travel experience.</p>

        <p>The laid-back atmosphere of the Christmas Island we know today is due to the blending together of many different cultures over the years. This diverse concoction of cultures has indeed written a very interesting history for the Island.
          While we see the first written record of the island in 1615, it wasn’t until Captain William Mynors, of the Royal Mary, spotted the island on Christmas Day of 1643, that it got its name.</p>
        <p>The discovery of phosphate in 1888 triggered an influx of Chinese, Malay, and Sikh workers, who often lived in very appalling conditions. To this day you will still hear many of the local residents speak their cultural language of Bahasa
          melayu, many different Chinese dialects, Cocos Malay, English, and many more. And during World War II (from 1942-45), the Japanese occupied the island, forcing most of the locals off the island, and capturing those who remained as
          prisoners of war.</p>
        <p>Up until 1957, Christmas Island was administered in Singapore, a British colony at the time. Then, on January 1, 1958, Australia purchased the island for today’s equivalent to roughly $3.8 million. To this day, “Territory Day” is
          celebrated annually on October 1st , and is a great sense of pride for most islanders.</p>
        <p>Christmas Island is made up of a fascinating mix of cultures that create a relaxed, friendly and vibrant community. About 2,000 local residents call the island home, including Chinese, and Malay as well as people from the mainland of
          Australia. The Malay community are Muslim, praying at the Mosque in Kampong at Flying Fish Cove. Members of the Chinese community follow a variety of religious beliefs including Buddhism, Christianity, and Confucianism. There are several
          temples, shrines, and Christian churches throughout the island.</p>
        <h2>Cultural Events</h2>
        <p>In addition to the usual Australian public holidays, cultural events include the Muslim festivals Hari Raya Puasa and Hari Raya Haji. There are a number of Chinese celebrations including Chinese New Year, the Hungry Ghost Festival (held
          on the 14th day of the seventh lunar month to appease the hungry ghosts that are unleashed from hell), and the Mooncake Festival, held on the 15th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar when the moon is at its brightest. The
          birthdays of Chinese temple gods are also celebrated at the Chinese temples around the island. The actual dates for these celebrations vary from year to year, please visit the Visitor Information Center for further information.</p>

        </div>
        <p>On an annual basis, an estimated 120 million red crabs migrate from the jungle to the sea to breed and spawn. This is a spectacular occurrence that happens nowhere else in the world and is often described as one of the wonders of the
          natural world. This migration lasts for several weeks, at times even closing most roads on the island. The crabs are protected by law and are treasured by the locals.</p>
        <p>The migration begins with the onset of the wet season rains. Although no one is certain to when this wet season actually begins, it typically runs from October thru December. While the rain provides the necessary wet conditions, the
          breeding sequence is also closely linked to the phases of the moon, as female crabs release their eggs into the sea during the high tide of the last lunar quarter. Males lead the initial migration to the shore where they dig burrows,
          before being joined by the female crabs. It is in these burrows that the actual mating occurs. Prior to returning inland, the males take one last dip in the ocean. The females begin to produce eggs within 3 days of the breeding and remain
          in the moist burrows dug by the males for another 12-13 days to allow the eggs to develop.</p>
        <p>Upon contact with the water, the eggs released by the females immediately hatch. Clouds of larvae are washed out to sea by the waves, and begin to develop, after a few months, into prawn-like animals called megalopae. The final stage in
          the process involves groups of these megalopae gathering in pools close to the shore for 1-2 days before transforming into young red crabs.</p>

        <h2>Scuba Diving</h2>
        <p>Christmas Island boasts some of the best scuba diving trips in Australia and has some of the longest drop-offs in the world. The island rises dramatically from the edge of the Java Trench, which is the Indian Ocean’s deepest point. It is
          this trench which creates endless miles of spectacular drop-off diving with most walls being only 5-60 feet from the shoreline!</p>
        <p>A scuba diving trip on Christmas Island will treat you to untouched corals, wall diving, hundreds of species of tropical fish, dolphins, whalesharks, warm clear water, and other magnificent marine life. A scuba trip here is sure to be one
          of the ultimate diving experiences!</p>
        <p>Christmas Island is surrounded by a narrow tropical reef which plunges into a bottomless abyss. This makes it the perfect destination for scuba diving trips! This reef if covered with many unspoiled corals and abundant species of marine
          life. The northern coast, in particular, boasts some of the most unspoiled corals in the world such as Acropora and plate corals which play host to a wide variety of small tropical species such as surgeon fish, wrasse, butterfly fish,
          gobies, anemones, eels and many others which are a photographer’s delight. If you’re lucky, you might also be paid a visit by one of the larger of the local species on your trip. Pelagics like rainbow runner, trevally, and tuna cruise
          along the walls, and you could even be graced with the presence of the majestic whaleshark. An encounter with one of these gentle giants, who often visit between November and April, is an experience no diver wants to miss!!</p>
        <h2>Snorkeling</h2>
        <p>With the coral reefs surrounding the island, snorkeling is a must on every visit to Christmas Island as the abundance of fish and coral to see is breathtaking, just a few feet from shore. The very popular, and easy to access, Flying Fish
          Cove, is great for snorkeling and swimming. When the waters are too rough at Flying Fish Cove, head over to Ethel Beach which may offer sheltered water and an equally dazzling array of fish and corals.</p>

        <h2>Turtle Spotting</h2>
        <p>Many people are unaware that Christmas Island is a prime turtle spotting location. Two different endangered species of turtle (the green sea turtle and the hawksbill sea turtle) can be seen on the island throughout the year, and the
          hatchlings may be spotted during turtle nesting seasons. Unlike mainland areas of Australia where turtle nesting usually takes place between October and November, nesting is a year-round activity on Christmas Island!</p>
        <p>Please note that the turtles are a protected species, and proper conduct must be observed around these beautiful creatures.</p>
