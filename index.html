        <p>The laid-back atmosphere of the Christmas Island we know today is due to the blending together of many different cultures over the years. This diverse concoction of cultures has indeed written a very interesting history for the Island.
          While we see the first written record of the island in 1615, it wasn’t until Captain William Mynors, of the Royal Mary, spotted the island on Christmas Day of 1643, that it got its name.</p>
        <p>The discovery of phosphate in 1888 triggered an influx of Chinese, Malay, and Sikh workers, who often lived in very appalling conditions. To this day you will still hear many of the local residents speak their cultural language of Bahasa
          melayu, many different Chinese dialects, Cocos Malay, English, and many more. And during World War II (from 1942-45), the Japanese occupied the island, forcing most of the locals off the island, and capturing those who remained as
          prisoners of war.</p>
        <p>Up until 1957, Christmas Island was administered in Singapore, a British colony at the time. Then, on January 1, 1958, Australia purchased the island for today’s equivalent to roughly $3.8 million. To this day, “Territory Day” is
          celebrated annually on October 1st , and is a great sense of pride for most islanders.</p>
        <p>Christmas Island is made up of a fascinating mix of cultures that create a relaxed, friendly and vibrant community. About 2,000 local residents call the island home, including Chinese, and Malay as well as people from the mainland of
          Australia. The Malay community are Muslim, praying at the Mosque in Kampong at Flying Fish Cove. Members of the Chinese community follow a variety of religious beliefs including Buddhism, Christianity, and Confucianism. There are several
          temples, shrines, and Christian churches throughout the island.</p>
        <h2>Cultural Events</h2>
        <p>In addition to the usual Australian public holidays, cultural events include the Muslim festivals Hari Raya Puasa and Hari Raya Haji. There are a number of Chinese celebrations including Chinese New Year, the Hungry Ghost Festival (held
          on the 14th day of the seventh lunar month to appease the hungry ghosts that are unleashed from hell), and the Mooncake Festival, held on the 15th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar when the moon is at its brightest. The
          birthdays of Chinese temple gods are also celebrated at the Chinese temples around the island. The actual dates for these celebrations vary from year to year, please visit the Visitor Information Center for further information.</p>
